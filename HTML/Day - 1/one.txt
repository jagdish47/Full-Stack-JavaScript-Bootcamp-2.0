Question - why we write index.html and default.html mostly ?

Whenever we upload file on server there is default files 
which server look them index.html and default.html are those files. 

mostly we create index.html we can also create default.html
but mostly developer create index.html so that why we create index.html
otherwise no restriction.



Question - Can we write index.html or index.htm ?

Yes, we can write index.html and index.htm both are correct way to
create html file but we mostly write index.html because extension
looks good if they are even like index.js, index.java, index.html
index.py so that's why we write index.html otherwise we can write index.htm to.

        Give up sitting dutifully at your desk. Leave
        your house or apartment. Go out into the world.

        It's all right to carry a notebook but a cheap
        one is best, with pages the color of weak tea
        and on the front a kitten or a space ship.

        Avoid any enclosed space where more than
        three people are wearing turtlenecks. Beware
        any snow-covered chalet with deer tracks
        across the muffled tennis courts.

        Not surprisingly, libraries are a good place to write.
        And the perfect place in a library is near an aisle
        where a child a year or two old is playing as his
        mother browses the ranks of the dead.

        Often he will pull books from the bottom shelf.
        The title, the author's name, the brooding photo
        on the flap mean nothing. Red book on black, gray
        book on brown, he builds a tower. And the higher
        it gets, the wider he grins.

        You who asked for advice, listen: When the tower
        falls, be like that child. Laugh so loud everybody
        in the world frowns and says, "Shhhh."

        Then start again.
